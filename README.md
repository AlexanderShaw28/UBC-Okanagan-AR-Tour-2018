# UBC-Okanagan-AR-Tour-2018
A tour of the UBC Okanagan Campus with immersive features, such as AR and 360 Video 


Description
We have built an application that enhances the campus tour that is currently offered at the University of British Columbia Okanagan Campus. Prospective students visit UBCO to learn about campus programs and student life; our application can be used to inform visitors and create an engaging tour experience. 
The application uses geolocation to show the user where they are on the campus while the application is open. Using geolocation, points of interest are placed around the campus, each containing information about Irving K. Barber School Programs. While every point of interest contains videos, images, text, and UBCO website links, certain points are enhanced with augmented reality or 360 videos. Augmented reality and 360 videos create an immersive environment for students on the tour, showing firsthand the exciting learning opportunities provided around the campus. UBCO website links and text descriptions help supplement the application with any other additional information that may be necessary for a complete experience.  
This application will help our recruiting team at UBCO show our prospective students everything the Irving K. Barber School has to offer in a new and exciting way.
